Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax, or AJAX) is a web development technique in which a web app fetches content from the server by making asynchronous HTTP requests, and uses the new content to update the relevant parts of the page without requiring a full page load. This can make the page more responsive, because only the parts that need to be updated are requested.
